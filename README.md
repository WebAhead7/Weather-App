# Weather-App: 
Weatherapp
There was a beautiful idea of building an app that would show the upcoming weather. The developers wrote a nice backend and a frontend following the latest principles and - to be honest - more info about any country. However, the developers add a lot of information to help you to be easy to know more info in this app. "Weather APP" is a beatifull app that depends on real information from a international API's about a lot of countries.
Just to search a capital name in the search icon, then you git a lot information like, the country name, population, live temperature a week, wind speed and also the country flag.

## Key takeaway:
Our major takeaway from this project is that we learnt how to access each part of the returned JSON data from the API response and use it in different ways. Although our methodology needs some refining, it’s bound to get better with more practice.
